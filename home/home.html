        <p>
            I use HTML when I am making website or when I am developing fivem server. 
            I am still trying to improve on HTML, but as you can see I made this website
            from scratch with the help of internet. But what is HTML? Well, HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
            is the standard language used for creating web pages. It provides a structure for the content on a
            web page, such as headings, paragraphs, and links, and uses a set of markup tags,
            such as p and a, to format and organize the content. HTML documents are interpreted
            by web browsers and displayed as web pages.

      <p>I use CSS when I am making webiste or when I am developing fivem servers. 
        I'm still trying to improve on CSS, but as you can see I made this website from scratch with the help from internet and HTML. 
        But what is CSS? well, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a code that helps make websites look pretty. 
        It allows the person who made the website to choose the colors, 
        fonts, and layouts, 
        so that the website looks the way they want it to.

        <p>I play fivem and I sometimes develop on this platform, helping people out and just having a great time.
          But with are fivem servers built? Well mostly out of the coding language LUA, but also HTML, CSS and JS or Json and
          coincidentallythis website is build with HTML, CSS and a little bit of JS. B
          ut what is fivem?. FiveM is a modification for the popular open-world video game Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) 
          that allows players to create and join custom multiplayer servers. FiveM adds a variety of new features to the game, 
          including custom vehicles, weapons, and game modes, as well as the ability for players to create their own role-playing experiences. 
          The modification is designed for players who want to play GTA V in a multiplayer environment with others who share similar interests and goals.

      <h1>About LUA</h1>
      <div class="lua-text">
        <img src="../img/infolua.png" alt="infolua" class="infolua">
        <p>Alright lets get this straight I know that lua also is used for making roblox servers
          but that is just notting compare to fivem servers. So Fivem servers are made with lua, lua is kind of the base for a fivem server.
          I am a Fivem developer and I use this code language to create/make a fivem server.
          but what is lua? Well, Lua is a lightweight, high-level, and interpreted programming language designed for extending applications. 
          It is often used in game development, such as in the popular game modification platform, FiveM. Lua is known for its simple syntax and ease of use, 
          making it a popular choice for adding scripting functionality to applications.

      <h1>About Video Editing</h1>
      <div class="videoediting-text">
        <img src="../img/videoeditinginfo.png" alt="videoeditinginfo" class="videoeditinginfo">
        <p>I edit video's for my own YouTube channel or for others just like when I develop on fivem servers.
          but what is video editing? Video editing is the process of manipulating and rearranging video shots to create a new work. 
          It involves cutting, splicing, and arranging video footage to create a new and improved version of the video. The goal of video editing is to tell a story or convey a message through visual media.
